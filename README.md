Welcome to my third project i've made which is a javascript game of pairs/memory. 

To create this project i have used HTML, SCSS and Javascript.

In the game you will have to match the emoji pairs which are stored in DIVS.
When the 'cards' are clicked classes will be changed to show and hide the targeted card. 
There are 12 pairs to match in total.
Once you have matched them all you will be greeted with an end game screen letting you know your time. 
You can then click play again which will allow you to start again with another random array of cards. 

Have Fun!
